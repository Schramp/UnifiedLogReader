To get testdata you need a iPhone.

When you do not have a MAC there are some ways to get the logging.
What I did is to make the iPhone produce a sysdiagnose as per

[this documentation](https://it-training.apple.com/tutorials/support/sup075/).



Next step would be to get the data from your phone. I used google drive for that.
